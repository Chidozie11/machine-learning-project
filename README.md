CSCI-5957-Spring-2020-Machine-Learning-Project

Project Phase I Description:

In this project phase, sensor data captured from a single person’s activity—ascending stairs, descending stairs, running, sitting, standing and walking—data are provided. Nevertheless, the data are raw data and thus, they are unprocessed data. Subsequently, the task for this project is to preprocess the data and build machine learning models to classify the activities of the person. 

Project Phase II Description:

In this project phase, we developed and applied two classification models on our preprocessed data from the project phase 1. We first developed one-vs-all logistic regression with regularization model to classify the different activities in our preprocessed data. Furthermore, we developed a multiclass version of support vector machine model using Gaussian kernel to classify the different activities in our preprocessed data. We also performed some accuracy analysis to determine the precision, recall and accuracy of each of the model.
