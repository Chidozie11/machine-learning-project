Project Description:

In this project, sensor data captured from a single person’s activity—ascending stairs, descending stairs, running, sitting, standing and walking—data are provided. Nevertheless, the data are raw data and thus, they are unprocessed data. Subsequently, the task for this project is to preprocess the data and build machine learning models to classify the activities of the person.
